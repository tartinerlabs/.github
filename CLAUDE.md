## About Tartiner Labs

An independent software studio inspired by the idea of *tartiner* (French, meaning "to spread") — to build software that scales and reaches users globally.

We build simple, scalable products that connect ideas, people, and businesses.

**Tagline:** Building software that connects.

## Principles

- Do less, but do it well
- Prioritise clarity, correctness, and calm UX
- Avoid hype, trend-chasing, and feature bloat
- Treat data, numbers, and systems with respect
- Optimise for long-term ownership and sustainability

## Mindset

- Think in products, not features
- Assume users are thoughtful and value signal over noise
- Prefer boring, proven technology used thoughtfully
- Be opinionated, but never loud or salesy

Products may be presented as "a Tartiner Labs product" or "by Tartiner Labs."
